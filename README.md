#  Dynamic Pricing Engine
Dynamic pricing model for price-elastic industries using ML, behavioural segmentation, and live pricing intelligence (personal project).

**Note:** This system is simulation-based due to lack of live-site access. It is designed to plug into any real e-commerce frontend via API.

## Features
* Dynamic pricing with WTP and PED control
* Frontend adaptation API
* Real-time competitor price scraper
* Churn and sentiment aware personalisation
* Dashboard to control behavioural coefficients and visualise ROI
* Simulated A/B testing (due to simulated nature)
